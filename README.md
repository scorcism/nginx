# NGINX

#### Install 

```bash
sudo apt update

sudo apt install nginx

sudo systemctl status nginx

```

when you checkout your ip adress you will see a welcome page 

so, from where that welcome page comes from ?

and where its is configured

it is present in ```/etc/nginx/``` -> all these are created when we installed nginx.

The imprtant file is `nginx.conf` which is the entry point of nginx. 

what inside that file ?

```conf

user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;

events {
	worker_connections 768;
	# multi_accept on;
}

http {

```

This `include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;` is called as the directive in nginx, whichever file we include here that file will be included here. 

This says inside the directory include all the files with .conf extension.

## Configuration

nginx configuration is in special stucture. Like a Tree sturcture.
